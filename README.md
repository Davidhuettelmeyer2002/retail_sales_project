### Analysis of Retail Sales Data - A Data Analytics Project

**Created by:** David HÃ¼ttelmeyer  

**Project description:**

In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a fictional retail company to identify key patterns and trends in customer behavior. I presented the results through visualizations in this Jupyter Notebook as well as in a Tableau dashboard.

**The key questions that should be answered:** 
1. How did the monthly revenue evolve?
2. Which age group generated the highest revenue?
3. Are there differences in purchasing behavior between women and men?
4. Which product category is the bestseller?
